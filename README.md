Lagrange Theorm Using python

## mpmath ->
    mpmath is a free (BSD licensed) Python library for real and complex floating-point arithmetic with arbitrary precision. ... It can be used as a library, interactively via the Python interpreter, or from within the SymPy or Sage computer algebra systems which include mpmath as standard component.
    
    
## symphy   
         the computer algebra system SymPy (Symbolic Python), written entirely in Python. SymPy is built out of nearly 100 open-source packages and features a unified interface. SymPy can be used to study elementary and advanced, pure and applied mathematics
         
## cmath
     Python cmath Module. Python has a built-in module that you can use for mathematical tasks for complex numbers. The methods in this       module accepts int , float , and complex numbers. It even accepts Python objects that has a __complex__() or __float__() method.


There are several printers available in SymPy. The most common ones are

str

srepr

ASCII pretty printer

Unicode pretty printer

LaTeX

MathML

Dot


    1. If all you want is the best pretty printing, use the ##init_printing()## function. This will automatically enable the best       printer          available in your environment.
    
    
    If you plan to work in an interactive calculator-type session, the  ## init_session() ## function will automatically import everything in SymPy, create some common Symbols, setup plotting, and run ##init_printing().
